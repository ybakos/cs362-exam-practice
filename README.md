# Exam Practice

This is a learning situation, to demonstrate your capabilities regarding testing.

## Setup

Fork and clone the repository. There is a _Gemfile_, so install the dependencies
with `bundle install`. The only dependency is rspec.

## Scenario

You have just taken over a legacy implementation of a "game"
that the previous developer never finished. There is an example program that "drives"
the game, so you can see the issues. Run it:

```
ruby lib/driver.rb
```

You should see the output of a variety of game combinations, only one of which
is valid. Feel free to take a look at _lib/driver.rb_.

## What to do

Run the test suite.

```
rspec
```

You should see a handful of skipped tests and one failing test.

### Step 1

Read the tests in _spec/game_spec.rb_.

Take a look at which test is failing, and fix the implementation in _game.rb_ to
get the test to pass.

### Step 2

Complete the remaining features, driven by tests. Perform a TDD workflow, replacing each "skip" with valid tests for each game scenario. If you have questions about the features, just ask.

### Step 3

Once your test suite is passing, rerun the driver program:

```
ruby lib/driver.rb
```

And verify the output is what you expect.

### Step 4

Refactor the test suite. There are a couple opportunities to improve the test suite,
and demonstrate your understanding of writing a maintainable test suite. Be sure
that the suite stays green.

### Step 5

Create a pull request.
